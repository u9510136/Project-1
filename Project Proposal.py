#       *   Background:
#               An anonymous benefactor has a $5,000,000 budget and hired a consulting firm to 
#               come up with recommendations for the best places to purchase real estate.  
#               The firm must analyze at least five markets in the United States to determine 
#               if the regions are lucrative investment options.  
#               Some factors the firm will consider when determining which areas to recommend are: 
#               ROI, current market conditions, and vacation rental conditions. 
#
#       *   Hypothesis:
#               Rental income in a specific state is determined by type of occupancy short term versus long term. 
#               Some factors to condider will be vacancy, days on the market and acqusition cost.
